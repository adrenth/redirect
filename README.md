With the Redirect TestLab you will be able to mass test (a selection) of redirect with several testers. Currently the following testers are finished:

* A redirect loop tester (if any of your redirects will result in a loop)
* A redirect count tester (counts the times your a request will be redirected until it reaches its destination)
* A response code tester (tests if the returned response code is ok)
* A redirect match tester (tests if your redirect will match the redirect you have configured).
* Final destination URL tester (determines the final destination URL).

You will be able to check all your redirects at once and check if there is any error in your configuration.

** Redirect Statistics **

The Statistics dashboard will be improved over time to get more insight in all your redirect traffic.

## Performance

All redirects are stored in the database and will be automatically "published" to a file which the internal redirect mechanism uses to determine if a certain request needs to be redirected. This is way faster than querying a database.

This plugin is designed to be fast and should have no negative effect on the performance of your website.

To gain maximum performance with this plugin:

* Use PHP7 (really you should), this increases the performance with 200%
* Enable redirect caching using a "in-memory" caching method (see Caching).
* Maintain your redirects frequently to keep the number of redirects as low as possible.
* Try to use placeholders to keep your number of redirect low (less redirects is better performance).

## Caching

If your website has a lot of redirects it is recommended to enable redirect caching. You can enable redirect caching in the settings panel of this plugin.
 
Only cache drivers which support tagged cache are supported. So driver `file` and `database` are not supported. For this plugin database and file caching do not increase performance, but can actually have a negative influence on performance. So it is recommended to use an in-memory caching solution like `memcached` or `redis`.

### How caching works

If caching is enabled (and supported) every request which is handled by this plugin will be cached. It will be stored with tag `Adrenth.Redirect`.

When you modify a redirect all redirect cache will be invalidated automatically. It is also possible to manually clear the cache using the 'Clear cache' button in the Backend.

## Placeholders

This plugin makes advantage of the `symfony/routing` package. So if you need more info on how to make placeholder requirements for your redirection URLs, please go to: https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/routing/introduction.html#usage
